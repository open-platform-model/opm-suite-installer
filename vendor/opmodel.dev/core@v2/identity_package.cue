// WHY #IdentityPackage is a publish gate rather than a field: nothing in
// `core` unifies against it; a publishing tool loads the artifact's identity
// package and unifies the loaded value, so the author reads CUE's own error at
// the field rather than a hand-written expected-versus-found message that can
// drift from this definition (enhancement 0011 D21/D22).
//
// Tooling writes exactly ModulePath and Version, located by THIS schema's field
// names rather than by a marker attribute (enhancement 0010 D5). Everything
// else derives, so a publisher gains nothing new to keep in step.
//
// It applies to BOTH artifact kinds — a module carries an identity package too
// (0010 D38, 0011 D12) — which is why it ships here rather than in a catalog: a
// module need not depend on any particular catalog.
//
// `strings` is a CUE BUILTIN, so this definition adds no edge to the module
// graph. That matters because an artifact's identity/identity.cue deliberately
// carries no INTRA-MODULE import — it sits at the bottom of its own module's
// import graph so leaf packages can source ModulePath/Version without a cycle.
// That invariant is preserved here because validation is EXTERNAL: `core`
// exports the shape and the publishing tool does the unifying. An identity file
// never imports `core`, and shipping this definition does not change what it
// imports. SPEC.md § 5.2 Rationale, "Why exactly two fields are authored" and
// "Why validation is external, and why we don't have `identity.cue` import
// `core` and embed this definition".

// IdentityPackage is the shape an artifact's committed identity package must
// match — the two values a release moves, plus everything that derives from
// them. The file it types is `identity/identity.cue`, at the root of a module
// or a catalog. A PUBLISH GATE, not a field of any artifact: a publishing
// tool unifies the loaded package against it. See SPEC.md § 5.2.
#IdentityPackage: {
	// Written by publish. Byte-identical to cue.mod's `module:` field, major
	// suffix included (enhancement 0010 D1).
	ModulePath!: #ModulePathType

	// Written by `version set` / `publish --version`. The build every
	// implementation key interpolates.
	Version!: #VersionType

	_ref: #ArtifactRef & {modulePath: ModulePath}

	// RegistryPath: the OCI repository, major-free. Projected through
	// #ArtifactRef rather than split again here — one decomposition site is the
	// whole point of that definition (enhancement 0010 D1).
	RegistryPath: _ref.registryPath // "opmodel.dev/catalogs/opm"

	// Major: the major the PATH declares.
	Major: _ref.major // "v1"

	// WHY this is the only assertion of that relation in the system: D40
	// originally had `core` assert it independently on both artifact types;
	// enhancement 0010 D43 removed that for #Catalog and D45 removed it for
	// #Module, both citing publish-side validation against THIS definition as
	// what replaces it. `identity_pins.cue`'s _pinModuleMajorSkewAccepted and
	// _pinCatalogMajorSkewAccepted are the deliberately-clean cases recording
	// that trade.
	//
	// So this is NOT a redundant check duplicating one on #Module or #Catalog.
	// There is nothing left to duplicate, and there is no downstream backstop
	// either. 0010 D43/D45 were written against a platform-side
	// subscription-selection major check — and that check HAS NEVER EXISTED IN
	// `core`. It was NOT removed by the scalar-subscription collapse; an
	// earlier revision of this comment said so and was wrong. Measured
	// 2026-08-08: no such assertion appears at any commit of src/, and the
	// pre-collapse subscription filter carried only range/allow/deny. Nothing
	// in #Platform ever related an entry's `version` to the "@vN" its
	// #registry key carries: not the removed Subscription definition, and
	// not #CatalogEntry, whose key binding constrains the embedded catalog's
	// modulePath but not the version major (0019 D5). The distinction
	// is about ownership rather than exposure: an unbuilt check has an owner
	// (the platform-side major-agreement check belongs to `library`'s
	// subscription-collapse work, not yet started), where a deleted one would
	// be a regression nobody holds. What is left today is a materialize-time
	// registry resolution failure naming a tag — a "@v1" module publishes v1.*
	// tags, so a 2.0.0 request simply does not resolve. That names the symptom,
	// not the mistake.
	//
	// Deleting this assertion therefore removes the relation from the system
	// outright.
	//
	// Asserting it here is also what puts the failure where it can be read: the
	// two values are WRITTEN in this file, so the error names the file the
	// author has open. SPEC.md § 5.2 Rationale, "Why the version/path major
	// relation is asserted here and nowhere else" and "Why it is asserted at
	// the point the values are written".

	// VersionMajor: derived from Version, never authored (enhancement 0010 D40),
	// and asserted equal to the major the path declares. The assertion is the
	// second declaration below — unification is the check. THIS IS THE ONLY
	// ASSERTION OF THAT RELATION IN THE SYSTEM; deleting it removes the
	// relation outright. See SPEC.md § 5.2.
	VersionMajor: "v" + strings.SplitN(Version, ".", 2)[0]
	VersionMajor: Major

	// WHY EXACTLY ONE BASE PREFIX PER KIND, with no ARBITRARY grouping
	// subdirectory beneath any of them (enhancement 0010 D42). A CONTRACT
	// kind's members file exactly one segment beneath the prefix, under the
	// member's own apiVersion — a segment DERIVED from the member's key, so
	// filing and key cannot drift (enhancement 0010 D49, amending D42); a
	// transformer files at the prefix itself, having no apiVersion (D44). This
	// map plus that derivation is a COMPLETE statement of the catalog's key
	// space, not a convenience for the common case: #CatalogMemberFQNGate
	// unifies a member's declared path with the derived filing path and builds
	// its key from kindPrefix[kind] directly, so a member under a segment its
	// key does not imply is refused rather than tolerated.
	//
	// ENUMERATED RATHER THAN A PATTERN CONSTRAINT, and the difference is not
	// stylistic. `[Kind=string]: RegistryPath + "/" + Kind` is unusable at the
	// call site: `id.kindPrefix.resources` yields `undefined field`, because a
	// pattern constrains keys that already exist rather than generating them.
	// Measured in enhancements/0011/experiments/01, finding (b). SPEC.md § 5.2
	// Rationale, "Why `kindPrefix` is enumerated rather than a pattern
	// constraint" and "Why no arbitrary grouping segment is admitted beneath a
	// kind prefix, and why the apiVersion segment is".

	// kindPrefix: the path prefix every catalog member of a given kind hangs
	// off. The major is NOT re-appended — a catalog member declares a
	// #PackagePathType (enhancement 0010 D1). Exactly one base prefix per
	// kind; a contract kind files one apiVersion segment beneath it, a
	// transformer at the prefix itself. Enumerated, not a pattern constraint.
	kindPrefix: {
		resources:    RegistryPath + "/resources"
		traits:       RegistryPath + "/traits"
		blueprints:   RegistryPath + "/blueprints"
		transformers: RegistryPath + "/transformers"
	}
}

// WHY #CatalogMemberFQNGate exists and is shaped this way. It is the
// enforcement point five decisions delegate to. Enhancement 0010 D17,
// D21, D25, D42 and D49 all state the catalog-member path and FQN rule and
// implement it nowhere; D21 in particular REMOVED `core`'s fqn derivation for every
// catalog member, accepting a measured loss — a catalog on 1.2.0 shipping
// `fqn: ".../secrets@1.1.0"` passes `cue vet -c` at exit 0 — explicitly in
// exchange for this gate. Under D4 a wrong key is permanent: modules match
// against it forever.
//
// A string comparison in Go would discard information this form keeps. A member
// one segment too deep fails on BOTH declaredModulePath and declaredFQN, and
// the second arrives wrapped as `2 errors in empty disjunction` because
// #FQNType is a disjunction (measured, enhancement 0010 D42).
//
// IT IS DELIBERATELY NOT EMBEDDED IN #Resource, #Trait, #Blueprint OR
// #ComponentTransformer. Expressing it inside a member's own definition would
// re-derive that member's `fqn` inside `core` and undo enhancement 0010 D21 —
// the derivation removal is what lets a contract declared in one catalog be
// fulfilled by a transformer in another on an independent release cadence.
// Unifying the gate is the check; the derivation stays out. SPEC.md § 5.3
// Rationale, "Why this gate exists at all", "Why it unifies rather than
// comparing, and what a string comparison would discard" and "Why the gate
// is not embedded in the member definitions".

// CatalogMemberFQNGate is the rule a publishing tool unifies every catalog
// member against — primitive OR transformer — to check that what the catalog
// AUTHORED agrees with what its identity package IMPLIES. A PUBLISH GATE, not
// part of any artifact: each `declared*` field is stated twice, once as
// authored and once as implied, and unification does the comparing. See
// SPEC.md § 5.3.

	// What identity/identity.cue implies. The path must sit under THIS catalog
	// (enhancement 0010 D17); a CONTRACT kind files one segment beneath its

	// Measured 2026-08-03 against cue v0.17.1: kind "transformers" with the
	// field absent yields the build with no error; kind "resources" supplying
	// it yields the apiVersion; kind "resources" omitting it fails
	// `declaredAPIVersion: field is required but not present`.

	// The key is interpolated from the CONTRACT for the three primitive kinds

	// The KEY does not carry the filing segment: the apiVersion reaches a

	declaredFQN: identity.kindPrefix[kind] + "/" + name + "@" + _keyVersion

	// NOTE what is absent: apiVersion is NOT checked against identity. Nothing

	// about that primitive's own shape, independent of the catalog's module
	// major and of the catalog's release SemVer (enhancement 0010 D4, D25) —
	// which is the entire point of the field. A gate that derived it would be
	// asserting a relation that does not exist.
