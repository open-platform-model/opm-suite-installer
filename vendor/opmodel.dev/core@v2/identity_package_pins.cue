// Schema-level pins for the identity package and the catalog-member gate
// (enhancement 0011 D21/D22, resting on 0010 D40, D42, D43, D44, D45).
//
// Same mechanism as identity_pins.cue, and the same rules apply: every value
// here is a HIDDEN top-level field, so `cue vet` evaluates it and fails on a
// conflict while an importing package never does, and none of them adds a row
// to src/INDEX.md.
//
// MUST-FAIL cases are commented out with the exact error uncommenting yields.
// A commented case is not self-verifying, so each was run once, in place, at
// the commit that introduced it; the recorded error is what `task vet` printed
// — with one documented exception at the bottom, a missing required field,
// which no `cue vet` invocation reports and whose recorded error is `cue
// export`'s. That exception names the command it was measured with.
//
// THESE PINS ARE LOAD-BEARING FOR TWO OTHER CHANGES. Enhancement 0010 D43 and
// D45 deleted `core`'s version-major assertion from #Catalog and #Module on the
// strength of the one #IdentityPackage makes, so _failIdentityMajorSkew below
// is the only place that relation is checked anywhere in the system — see the
// note on that case for why the downstream backstop D43/D45 assumed was never
// built in the first place.
//
// NOTE ON THE FILENAME: this file must NOT be named with a leading underscore.
// CUE skips files whose name begins with "_", so an
// "_identity_package_pins.cue" would be silently unloaded and every pin below
// would vet clean by never running.

// Each was uncommented once and run; the recorded error is `task vet`'s output.

// THE MOST LOAD-BEARING CASE IN THIS FILE — a declared version whose major
// disagrees with the path's. Enhancement 0010 D43 and D45 deleted the
// equivalent assertion from #Catalog and #Module on the strength of this one,
// so if it stops firing, NOTHING in the system checks the relation.
//
// D43/D45 recorded a downstream backstop for that exposure — the platform's
// subscription-selection major check. It was NEVER BUILT in `core`, rather
// than built and then removed: an earlier revision of this note blamed the
// scalar-subscription collapse and was wrong. Measured 2026-08-08, no such
// assertion appears at any commit of src/, and the pre-collapse
// subscription filter carried only range/allow/deny. Nothing in #Platform
// ever related an entry's `version` to the "@vN" its #registry key carries:
// not the removed Subscription definition, and not #CatalogEntry, whose key
// binding constrains modulePath but not the version major (0019 D5); the
// platform-side check is owned by
// `library`'s subscription-collapse work, not yet started. The residue is a
// materialize-time registry resolution failure naming a tag that does not
// resolve, which is a symptom rather than a diagnosis. Treat this case as
// having no safety net beneath it.
//
// The error names the DERIVED field rather than either authored one, which is

// shipped, "/workload" where the member's apiVersion belongs. This is the case
// enhancement 0010 D42 exists for, and D49's amendment keeps it failing: the
// only segment the filing derivation produces is the member's own apiVersion,
// so "/workload" conflicts with "/v1beta1". Re-measured 2026-08-10 under the
