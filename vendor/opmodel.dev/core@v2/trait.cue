		// apiVersion: this contract's own level, and the only component of its
		// key (enhancement 0010 D4). Moved when this trait's shape breaks — a
		// catalog release does not move it, which is what lets a module's

		// fqn: AUTHORED by the catalog at the definition site, not derived here
		// (enhancement 0010 D21), so fqn, modulePath and catalogVersion trace
		// to one identity package and a release moves them together. `core` no
		// longer refuses a value disagreeing with this definition's own fields;

	// WHY two fields: see #Resource.matchLabels for why the two cannot be one
	// field. NOT rendered: matchLabels does not reach #TransformerContext.

	// matchLabels: this trait's MATCHING identity — the keys a
	// #ComponentTransformer.requiredLabels predicate selects on, unified
	// wholesale into every #Component that attaches this trait. Separate from
	// metadata.labels, which carries categorisation and is never unified
	// upward. NOT rendered (D36). See SPEC.md § 2.2.
	matchLabels?: #LabelsAnnotationsType // Example: {"opm.opmodel.dev/workload-type": "stateless"}

	// WHY: see #Resource.#nameConstraint. The rule and its measured pitfalls are
	// stated once there (SPEC.md § 2.1 Rationale, "Why the primitive declares
	// the name rule and the component asserts it"); this slot is the same slot.

	// nameConstraint: the name rule a kind this primitive renders enforces on
	// the owning component's metadata.resourceName (enhancement 0019 D21);
	// top when the primitive is indifferent, which is the default. A hidden
	// definition field: never optional, never guarded on presence. MAY be
	// computed from this primitive's own fields (0019 D23). See SPEC.md § 2.2.
	#nameConstraint: _

	// WHY it exists on a trait: see #Resource.fulfilment for why it is
	// declared rather than derived, and why the guard is the kernel's.
	// `backup` (hypothetical: no catalog ships it today) is the case this
	// exists for: a catalog declares the trait and ships nothing that renders
	// it, which is today indistinguishable from having forgotten to.

	// fulfilment: where this contract's implementation is expected to come
	// from. "catalog" (the default) means the declaring catalog implements
	// it; "provider" means it deliberately ships no transformer and a
	// platform must carry exactly one transformer requiring this contract.
	// See #Resource.fulfilment and SPEC.md § 2.2 (enhancement 0010 D32).
	fulfilment: *"catalog" | "provider"

	// WHY no default here: the DECLARING CATALOG states the posture, and it
	// must state it as a DEFAULT so a module can narrow it at the attachment
	// site:
	//
	//   optional: bool | *true    // advisory — a workload without an
	//                             // autoscaler still runs
	//   optional: bool | *false   // load-bearing — an unhandled backup means
	//                             // there are no backups
	//
	//   #traits: (BackupFQN): Backup & {optional: true}   // not my data
	//
	// `core` cannot express "you may suggest but not decide" in a field, so
	// #TraitOptionalGate below carries it instead. The full argument is
	// SPEC.md § 2.2 Rationale, "Why optionality is a property of the Trait,
	// and why `core` states no default for it" and "Why the earlier
	// demand-side marker was dropped".

	// optional: whether an unhandled demand for this trait fails the render or
	// degrades to a warning naming the trait (enhancement 0010 D46, amending
	// D28's trait half). NO DEFAULT HERE: the declaring catalog states the
	// posture as a default (`bool | *true` or `bool | *false`), a module may
	// narrow it at the attachment site, and #TraitOptionalGate refuses a
	// catalog that pins a concrete value. See SPEC.md § 2.2.
	optional: bool

	// MUST be an OpenAPIv3 compatible schema
	// The field and schema exposed by this definition
	spec!: (strings.ToCamel(metadata.#definitionName)): _

	// Resources that this trait can be applied to (full references)
	appliesTo!: [...#Resource]
}

// WHY it ships in `core` beside the identity gates and is checked the same
// way — the schema is the contract, CUE is the engine that checks contracts,
// and what the author reads is CUE's own error (0011 D21/D22).
//
// WHY it TAKES THE FIELD, NOT THE TRAIT. `#TraitOptionalGate & {trait:
// SomeTrait}` would drag the trait's `spec` into concreteness checking under
// `cue vet -c`, and a spec is a SCHEMA that must never be concrete.
//
// WHY it MUST BE UNIFIED INTO A NON-HIDDEN VALUE. `cue vet -c` does not check
// hidden fields, so a gate parked in a `_`-prefixed slot passes silently while
// checking nothing. SPEC.md § 5.1 Rationale.

// #TraitOptionalGate: what `opm catalog publish` unifies against, once per
// published #Trait, to hold catalogs to the two rules #Trait.optional cannot
// express itself: a posture is stated, and it is not pinned. Takes the FIELD,
// not the trait, and MUST be unified into a non-hidden value. See SPEC.md
// § 5.1.
#TraitOptionalGate: {
	// The value under test: some published trait's `optional`.
	optional: bool

	// RULE 1 — the catalog stated a posture. Interpolation forces the
	// disjunction to its default, so a trait that never mentions `optional`
	// fails here. Reported as `incomplete value bool`, and visible only under
	// `cue vet -c` — which publish runs, and a catalog author's plain
	// `task vet` does not.
	_stated: "\(optional)"

	// RULE 2 — and did not PIN it. Both arms must remain admissible, so a
	// concrete value, which no module could ever override, is refused. Unlike
	// rule 1 this is visible under plain `cue vet`.
