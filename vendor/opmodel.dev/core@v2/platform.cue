// WHY an import instead of a version string: a version string is inert data
// nothing in a CUE build resolves, so the kernel pulled the build out of band
// and handed the result back on a materialized twin. The entry carries the
// catalog itself, resolved through the platform module's cue.mod like every
// other dependency, which is what lets one render build evaluate the
// instance, the platform and the catalog together (enhancement 0019 D5, D9).
// Catalog selection stays a pure function of committed source (0010 D14):
// cue.mod is committed source, and a prerelease is still selected by naming
// it there. SPEC.md § 3.4 Rationale, "Why an import instead of a version
// string", "Why the version is derived and not authored" and "Why the whole
// transformer map".

// #CatalogEntry declares that a #Platform admits a catalog, by carrying the
// imported catalog value whole on #catalog. `version` and `#transformers`
// are derived readouts, never authored; an expected `version` stamped at
// platform-generation time unifies with the readout, so wrong bytes are a
// build conflict naming the entry (0019 D13). One entry per catalog path;
// two builds of one catalog is two platforms. See SPEC.md § 3.4.
#CatalogEntry: {
	enable: bool | *true

	// The imported catalog, embedded whole.
	#catalog: #Catalog

	// Derived readouts of the catalog's release-stamped identity. Neither
	// is authored; #Catalog.metadata.version! has no development default,
	// so an unstamped catalog refuses as incomplete rather than rendering
	// wrong. A generation-time expected `version` stamp unifies with the
	// readout (0019 D13 tripwire).
	version:       #catalog.metadata.version
	#transformers: #TransformerMap & #catalog.#transformers
}

// WHY no per-contract routing relation: 0015's pre-draft named a
// `ContractRouting` a caller unifies per contract; `overSubscribed` and
// `routable` state the arity rule for every contract at once and
// `requiredBy` is the list the relation took as input, so the relation
// would be a second statement of the same two facts with no consumer
// (Principle V). SPEC.md § 3.4 Rationale, "Why no per-contract routing
// relation".

// #ContractInventory: what a #Platform derives about the contracts its
// enabled catalogs define and its enabled transformers require (enhancement
// 0015 D1, D2, D5, D18): the members and their defining catalogs, the
// required demands per contract, the three reports and the three booleans
// they imply. Lives on #Platform.#contracts, derived and never authored; it
// reports and never refuses. See SPEC.md § 3.4.
#ContractInventory: {
	// Every contract every enabled entry's catalog lists, keyed by contract
	// FQN and carrying the member value as the catalog lists it (the
	// primitive itself, provenance stamped).
	defined: [#ContractFQNType]: #Resource | #Trait | #Blueprint

	// Contract FQN to the registry key (module path) of the catalog listing
	// it: the value every diagnostic prints beside the contract.
	definedBy: [#ContractFQNType]: #ModulePathType

	// Contract FQN to the implementation FQNs of every enabled transformer
	// whose requiredResources or requiredTraits name it. Required demands
	// only (0010 D32: optional consumption is tolerance, not fulfilment);
	// a defined contract nothing requires maps to an empty list.
	requiredBy: [#ContractFQNType]: [...#ImplFQNType]

	// Provider-fulfilled resources and traits required by nothing. A
	// report the operator surfaces as a non-gating condition (D18); never a
	// refusal. Blueprints never appear: a blueprint carries no fulfilment.
	unfulfilled: [...#ContractFQNType]

	// Provider-fulfilled resources and traits required by transformers
	// from more than one catalog, a transformer's catalog being its stamped
	// metadata.modulePath. What the generation step refuses on (0010 D37).
	overSubscribed: [...#ContractFQNType]

	// Pairs of enabled transformers whose match predicates are comparable
	// over at least one shared catalog-fulfilled contract: `broader`
	// matches every component `narrower` matches. Provider-fulfilled
	// contracts are `overSubscribed`'s business, not this list's.
	comparable: [...{
		broader:  #ImplFQNType
		narrower: #ImplFQNType
		contracts: [...#ContractFQNType]
	}]

	// True exactly when nothing is unfulfilled. A report, never a gate.
	fulfilled: bool & (len(unfulfilled) == 0)

	// True exactly when nothing is over-subscribed. The gate the generation
	// step (operator, CLI) reads; `core` itself refuses nothing on it.
	routable: bool & (len(overSubscribed) == 0)

	// True exactly when nothing is comparable. The second gate the
	// generation step (operator, CLI) reads; `core` itself refuses
	// nothing on it.
	discriminated: bool & (len(comparable) == 0)
}

// WHY the fold copies per entry rather than unifying entry maps: the
// catalog's provenance stamp (0010 D25) refuses a foreign transformer
// unified into another catalog's member map, so map-level unification fails
// on healthy multi-catalog input (measured,
// enhancements/0019/experiments/05-match-in-one-build). Two entries writing
// one composed FQN still unify at that key: agreement collapses, divergent
// bodies conflict loudly. #matchers is removed (0019 D17): its only reader
// was the Go matcher the render-path collapse deletes, and the in-build
// matching glue folds its own buckets from #composedTransformers in a shape
// core's list-valued buckets never matched. SPEC.md § 3.4 Rationale, "Why
// the key binding is structural rather than a check", "Why the fold copies
// rather than unifies" and "Why #matchers is removed rather than derived".

// A #Platform is a path-keyed registry of catalog entries, each carrying its
// imported catalog, plus the derived #composedTransformers fold over the
// enabled entries and the derived #contracts inventory. A platform value is
// complete on its own: no Materialize step, no materialized twin, no reverse
// index. See SPEC.md § 3.4.
#Platform: {
	kind: "Platform"

		name!:        #NameType
		description?: string
		labels?:      #LabelsAnnotationsType
		annotations?: #LabelsAnnotationsType
	}

	// Informational. Future enhancement may enforce type-vs-transformer
	// compatibility; today it is an authored discriminator the matcher
	// does not consult (014 OQ2).
	type!: string

	// Path-keyed: the map key is the catalog's CUE module path, bound into
	// the embedded catalog's metadata.modulePath, so key-versus-import
	// drift is a build conflict naming the entry (0019 D5). Exactly one
	// entry per path; CUE map semantics enforce uniqueness (0010 D13).
	#registry: [Path=#ModulePathType]: #CatalogEntry & {#catalog: metadata: modulePath: Path}

	// Derived, never runtime-filled: the fold of every enabled entry's
	// #transformers, copied per entry by comprehension (see the WHY block
	// above). Empty when the registry is empty or fully disabled.
	#composedTransformers: {
		for _, entry in #registry if entry.enable {
			for fqn, tf in entry.#transformers {(fqn): tf}
		}
	}

	// WHY the inventory reports rather than asserts (0015 D18): an
	// assertion inside #Platform is a bottom on the first over-subscribed
	// contract, so the value cannot name it and every diagnostic reads a
	// failed value. `routable: false` is the value the generation step
	// (operator, CLI) refuses on, naming `overSubscribed` and `definedBy`;
	// `fulfilled: false` is surfaced as a non-gating condition and gates
	// nothing, which an in-schema assertion could not express.
	//
	// WHY over-subscription counts catalogs, not transformers: one
	// provider catalog may carry two adapters over one contract (k8up's
	// Schedule and PreBackupPod), and the shipped CLI refusal already
	// counts catalogs. `_providers` keys a struct by each requiring
	// transformer's stamped metadata.modulePath, which deduplicates per
	// catalog; the stamp is unforgeable (0010 D25), so a catalog cannot
	// pose as two.
	//
	// WHY comparability folds all three required demand kinds: what keeps a
	// shared catalog-fulfilled bucket legal is a differing required LABEL
	// VALUE *or* a distinct required TRAIT, not labels alone. Measured
	// against catalog_opm `opm` 4.4.0: in the ContainerResource bucket
	// `hpa` declares no requiredLabels while `deployment` declares
	// `workload-type: stateless`, so on labels alone `hpa`'s predicate is a
	// subset of `deployment`'s and the report would falsely name a pair that
	// is supposed to fire together; their requiredTraits (the catalog's
	// ScalingTrait against none) is what separates them. SPEC.md § 3.4
	// Rationale, "Why the inventory reports and does not refuse", "Why
	// over-subscription counts catalogs" and "Why the predicate is every
	// required demand, not only labels".

	// Derived, never authored or runtime-filled: the contract inventory,
	// folded from every enabled entry's #resources, #traits and #blueprints
	// and crossed with the required demands of #composedTransformers.
	// Empty, fulfilled and routable on an empty or fully disabled registry.
	// An over-subscribed platform still evaluates; refusing it is the
	// generation step's act. See SPEC.md § 3.4.
